!!! tip
    This is not recommended.

!!! warning
    By editing the MainModule, you decline mainstream Carbon updates. You will not recieve bug fixes, security patches and command additions.  
    To recieve mainstream Carbon updates whilst still having a custom version of it, refer to [Customising the script](index.md#customising-the-script-code-modification)

## Getting started
To begin, you are required to have the MainModule inserted in the game.   
If you wish to prevent people from stealing it, place it into ServerScriptService or ServerStorage.
