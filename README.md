# Carbon
Carbon is a ROBLOX Administration script, that is built to be highly customizable.

Carbon will be fully documented, with documentation being updated as APIs are being added.


## Syncing the project into ROBLOX
**I do not recommend editing the source code itself for a custom version. Check the documentation which will cover in detail how to create a custom version. The method in the documentation will still allow you to get mainstream Carbon updates.**

This project utilises [Rojo](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo) for syncing into ROBLOX.

This is available as a [Studio plugin](https://www.roblox.com/library/1211549683/Rojo-0-4-13) (REQUIRED)

You will also either need the [Rojo.exe](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo/releases) or the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo)

**I recommend the VS:C extension, as it makes using Rojo so much easier.**
